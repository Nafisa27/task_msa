# Expense Tracker App

This is a simple Expense Tracker application built with Flutter. It allows users to add, edit, and delete expenses. Each expense entry includes a description, amount, and date. The app uses GetX for state management and Hive for local storage.

## Features

- Add new expenses
- Edit existing expenses
- Delete expenses
- View a list of all expenses
- Persistent storage using Hive
- Reactive state management using GetX

## Why Use GetX

GetX is a powerful, lightweight solution for Flutter that combines state management, dependency injection, and route management. Here are some reasons why we chose GetX for this project:

1. **Simplicity**: GetX provides an easy-to-use and intuitive syntax for managing state, which reduces boilerplate code.
2. **Performance**: GetX is very performant because it uses a reactive programming model that only rebuilds the parts of the UI that need to be updated.
3. **Dependency Injection**: GetX allows easy dependency injection, making it simpler to manage dependencies across the app.
4. **Route Management**: GetX provides a simple and powerful way to manage navigation within the app.
5. **Reactive Programming**: GetX's reactive state management allows the UI to automatically update when the state changes, providing a smooth user experience.
